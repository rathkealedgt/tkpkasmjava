# tkpkasmjava
Adapted from https://teachingkidsprogramming.org/.

This repository is meant to mkae it easier for students to download and install the TKP Java files. Once 
they have signed into their Kasm Workspace, they will be able to download the install.sh file and then
execute the file to install the TKP files.

I have started to introduce my students to Open Source along side Ubuntu as I am trying to moce away
from Windows. Because most students still run Windows, I decided it was easier to host Kasm Workspaces
on site and spin up containers that already have all required software - no more wasting time trying
to get software installed!
